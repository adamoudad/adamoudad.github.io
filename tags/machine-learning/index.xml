      <description>I stumbled upon an article using neural networks that guess passwords. It shows an original application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). What are GAN?   Generative Adversarial Networks are three words that have been used a lot during the past few years in Artificial Intelligence research. It refers to neural networks that have been trained in the adversarial framework. A neural network is a function with many parameters that can be optimized from assessing the errors the network makes from the expected output, or ground-truth.</description>

      <title>A guided tour of classification metrics</title>

      <description>Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are metrics used to assess automatic classifiers. These metrics are calculated from a confusion matrix. Say we have spam filter which tells whether a mail is spam or not. With a test dataset of 100 spam emails and 900 non-spam, we get the following results.     Actual class: Spam Actual class: Non-spam     Prediction class: Spam 85 100   Prediction class: Non-spam 15 800     This confusion matrix shows the confusions the system makes in its predictions.</description>

      <title>List of datasets</title>

      <description>Machine Learning requires data. To obtain some, one way is to scrape or retrieve data directly from somewhere. Another way is to reuse datasets freely available over the internet, specially made for most common tasks. Because it has become so frequent for data scientists to take much time searching and processing data, Google has its own Dataset search tool. There are also big lists of datasets for research purpose, such as this one.</description>
