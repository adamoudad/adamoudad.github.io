      <description>Character, word, sentence and document embeddings are popular because they are efficient. In the case of words, such embeddings represent words in their meaning, their role and their hierarchy in texts.  We have seen a clear improvement of word embeddings thanks to Mikolov et al. at Google, with Word2Vec in 2014. Since then, many kinds of embeddings have been developped for different purposes. We can cite for example Fasttext by Facebook, Bert by Google.</description>

      <description>This is one of the most fearful grammatical points of any japanese learner during their journey to japanese mastery.  This article gives some rules that will help confusion and will make you sound like a native. Relatively to information intended to be delivered 伝えたい情報   は will always precede the information, whereas が will follow it. Similarily, は will always precede an interrogative, while が will follow it.</description>

      <description>I followed this good tutorial on how to add \(\KaTeX\) to hugo.  Here is an example showing that KaTeX (should) now work. $$∫ab x^2 dx$$  Here are some remarks I have about the original tutorial. Auto-rendering   Add the following script in the footer &amp;lt;script defer src=&amp;#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.0-rc.1/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js&amp;#34; integrity=&amp;#34;sha384-yACMu8JWxKzSp/C1YV86pzGiQ/l1YUfE8oPuahJQxzehAjEt2GiQuy/BIvl9KyeF&amp;#34; crossorigin=&amp;#34;anonymous&amp;#34; onload=&amp;#34;renderMathInElement(document.body);&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;   This will activate the auto rendering Other remarks     {{ end }} is unnecessary, only write the following to include the katex.</description>
