      <description>A great presentation software is a precious tool, even so when working remotely. If you are on MacOS, you will likely want to use Keynote, which has great features such as displaying a presenter view on one screen with a timer while displaying the presentation on another screen. On Linux, however, most PDF readers, like evince if you are using GNOME, have quite limited features for presenting.
 Recently I found about pdfpc, a great tool to do presentations with a PDF document, on Linux.</description>
