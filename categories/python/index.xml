      <description>If you own an Android smartphone, you are familiar with that pattern you chose to lock your phone with. Every time, you pick your phone and mechanically draw these lines on your screen, connecting the dots to form the unlock pattern.
Android lockscreen.
This lock mechanism is more intuitive than using a sequence of numbers (such as PIN), but has its drawbacks, as research papers show how you can efficiently guess the unlock pattern from</description>

      <description>tqdm 1is a Python library for adding progress bar. It lets you configure and display a progress bar with metrics you want to track. Its ease of use and versatility makes it the perfect choice for tracking machine learning experiments.
I organize this tutorial in two parts. I will first introduce tqdm, then show an example for machine learning. For each code fragment in this article, we will import the sleep function from Python&amp;#39;s time library as it will let us slow down the program to see the progress bar update.</description>
